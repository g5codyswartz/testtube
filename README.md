Welcome to your Node.js project on Cloud9 IDE!

This chat example showcases how to use `socket.io` with a static `express` server.

## Running the server

1) Open `server.js` and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu.

2) Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:

    $ node server.js

Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://projectname-username.c9.io/'. As you enter your name, watch the Users list (on the left) update. Once you press Enter or Send, the message is shared with all connected clients.


IDEAS

--
When cursor is in an input field pop-up with pre-generated liquids
might need a hierarchy system, for example page linking, location based, etc

--
Have a hook on chrome network requests and have a box that shows how many 
connections are loading and on hover show more detailed information 
such as whether or not the connection was successful - almost like 
good ol' IE script error counters.
